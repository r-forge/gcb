The usual installation procedure should go something like this:
1. procure a machine with a cuda capable nvidia gpu
2. install nvidia's cuda capable video driver
3. install nvidia's cuda toolkit
4. install this package using R

The package ardblas attempts to follow the standard R package installation
procedure. To install the package, you must first install
nvidia's cuda toolkit (preferably version 2.3) available from

http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_get.html

You need not use a gpu, to use the package without a cuda capable gpu and
video driver, please skip to the third section 'machines w/o a gpu at all'.

To use a gpu, you will need a cuda capable gpu and a cuda capable video driver.
You can get the video driver from

http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_get.html

also.

For exotic R installs, the following configure arguments may help:
--with-r-lib=<location of R shared libraries>
--with-r-include=<location of R header files>

+ machines w/ older gpus
=========================

See

http://brainarray.mbni.med.umich.edu/Brainarray/Rgpgpu/#issues

for a table listing compute capabilities of various nVidia cards.
If you have a GPU that has compute capability < 1.3 then
the double precision functions may not function correctly!

==============================================
+ your cuda install is not in /usr/local/cuda
==============================================

If the CUDA toolkit is not in '/user/local/cuda' then you can specify the
location of the CUDA toolkit by either setting the environment variable
'CUDA_HOME' or using one of the following commands.

From a terminal:

R CMD INSTALL --configure-args='--with-cuda-home=<path-to-cuda>' <path-to-package>ardblas_<version-of-package>.tar.gz

From inside an R environment:

install.packages(ardblas, configure.args = '--with-cuda-home=/usr/local/cuda')

====================
+ mac os x systems
====================

Mac OS X is unsupported. The source package may install correctly with a little
tweeking.

==================
+ windows systems
==================

Windows is unsupported.
